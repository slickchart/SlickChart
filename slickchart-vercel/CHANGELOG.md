## 2026-07-08 — Square live sync + instant paths

Products, services, prices, clients, appointments, and tax rate now update from Square automatically — no reboot, no manual re-push.

- **Catalog auto-sync** (`_autoSyncCatalog`): background refresh of products/services/prices on boot, on opening the Shop / routine builder / treatment picker, on a 60 s poll, and on app refocus. Throttled, in-flight-locked, fingerprint change-detected.
- **Client auto-sync** (`_autoSyncCustomers`): new Square customers are auto-added as clients. Additive only — never overwrites an existing chart or deletes anyone.
- **Service/variation price fix**: change-detection fingerprint now includes per-variation prices and `priceMax`, so tiered service price changes re-sync.
- **Checkout menu freshness**: `_coMenu` cache expires after 60 s and is invalidated on catalog change, so invoice prices stay current.
- **Appointments auto-refresh**: bookings added/moved/canceled in Square surface on their own (60 s poll + refocus, with fingerprint change-detection so the screen only repaints on a real change). Previously manual-only.
- **Tax rate refresh**: 5-min TTL instead of a permanent cache, so a Square tax-rate change comes through without a reboot. Keeps the last known rate on transient errors instead of dropping tax to 0.
- Background poll pauses when the tab is hidden. All syncs fail silently when Square is unreachable.
- Escaped Square customer/product names in the integrations lists.

**Limitation:** pull-based, so "instant" means "within ~60 s or on refocus." True sub-second updates would need Square webhooks (server-side `/api/square`).

## 2026-07-08 — Bug sweep, round 17

- **Provider-switcher CSS-injection fix** (client): brand colors received via the bridge were used raw inside the switcher's `style` attribute (linear-gradient/box-shadow). A malformed value could break out of the attribute — now normalized to a valid 6-digit hex with a fallback, matching `applyClientTheme`.
- Escaped provider initials/first/kind/nextDate in the provider switcher; the suggested-time rebook status pill (date + time, injected via innerHTML); and client name/nextVisit in the protocol-apply picker.
- Verified clean: earnings/reports math (revenue allocation guarded, avg divide-by-zero safe, refunded/canceled excluded; tips flow through Square's total via a request flag, no in-app tip math), protocol editor (`_protoMins` free-text-safe, inputs escaped, name/steps validated), export center (all CSV exports route through the formula-injection-guarded `_downloadCSV`).

## 2026-07-08 — Bug sweep, round 16

- Escaped `workspace.name` in the 3 places it's displayed (studio header + staff-invite screens) — provider-set, self-XSS surface.
- Verified clean: notification/announcement feed (`notifCard` escapes all fields; announcement post validates + escapes on render), message-photo display (`_imgSrc` whitelists data:image/http(s)/blob and rejects `javascript:`/`data:text/html`), branding/theme color picker (input-validated *and* output-validated — only valid hex reaches CSS, with default fallbacks), routine streak (local-date day boundaries, increments once/day, `_engStreakLive` gates stale streaks). Team/staff invite is a UI-only demo (no persistence).

## 2026-07-08 — Bug sweeps, rounds 11–15

Systematic 5-area hardening passes. Highlights:

- **Messaging unread badge** (client): now clears when the thread is opened, instead of lingering until the next data poll.
- **Booking/calendar**: escaped client·treatment on request cards; confirmed `confirmBooking` is idempotent.
- **Welcome/install** (client): escaped the provider welcome message and its dismiss key (onclick JS-string breakout).
- **Referral-partner intro**: escaped name/email and the intro-message textarea (a `</textarea>` in a name could break out).
- **Client list / profile**: escaped client name/treatment and profile field values (provider-entered chart data).
- Verified clean: tax/money math, `.ics` calendar generation, CSV export (formula-injection guarded), photo compression, AI-brief generation (falls back to a chart-based brief; race-condition guarded), inventory, payments/refund exclusion from revenue & A/R, routine reminders, series tracking.
- Defensive guards added: skip Square catalog products with no id; guard product import against nameless rows.

## Earlier

Rounds 1–10 of bug sweeps and prior feature work (Square catalog auto-sync groundwork, phantom-toast fix, saved-summary tabs, keyboard-blocking-search fix, and the broader escaping/money/date hardening across both apps). See commit history.
